Collection of analyses &amp; visualisations done on various NBA datasets

I've loved the sport of basketball for a long time and have been invested in the development of two things over the last few years - sports analytics & young generational talents. 
The last few years have blessed the basketball world with phenomenal talent, including the likes of Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Ja Morant and so many more 
who make up the new generation.

This project is an effort to analyse this new generation of upcoming superstars, study their strengths and weaknesses and predict their future player development.

Much of it is exploratory & visual as I trace their first few years in the league or compare them to established players and playstyles. 
Much of it is connected to the teams they play for and the teams they play against. 
Much of it must also be connected to a whole host of other things, and I hope that as time goes on, I can find those things and develop comprehensive models and classifications.

At the end of the day, there is one element on the court that cannot be captured in numbers. The goal is to capture everything else.
